# DigitalDepot

Welcome to my furniture ecommerce website! This project represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer, as it is my first solo full stack website using the powerful PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) stack. Throughout the development process, I challenged myself to learn and implement new technologies, such as Framer Motion, Lottie, and lazy loading, which have greatly enhanced the user experience.

# Simple and Intuitive Shopping Experience
My primary goal is to provide a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience for users. With a user-friendly UI and intuitive design, navigating through the website is a breeze. The minimalist and responsive design of the page is aesthetically pleasing, appealing to modern furniture enthusiasts.

# Easy Product Discovery and Navigation
Finding the perfect furniture piece is effortless with an extensive range of home shop categories and special offers. The shopping navigation bar includes convenient filter methods, enabling users to browse through specific categories like living room, bedroom, workspace, and kitchen. Additionally, sub-categories further refine the search, ensuring users can quickly locate their desired products. For even more convenience, I've implemented an efficient search bar that automatically scans product titles, types, categories, and IDs, delivering relevant results instantly.

# Seamlessly Interactive Product Details
When a user clicks on a product, they are presented with comprehensive details, including the ability to select the quantity and add the item to their cart or save it to their wishlist. One of the highlights of my design is the user-friendly Framer Motion animation, which creates a delightful preview of product images. Users can smoothly scroll through the images, enhancing their engagement and providing a captivating visual experience.

# Effortless Cart Management
Upon adding a product to the cart, users are greeted with a visually pleasing confirmation checkmark animation, created with Lottie. The cart page provides users with complete control over their items, allowing them to update, delete, or view more details about each product. The total amount is prominently displayed at the bottom, ensuring transparency, and a convenient checkout button allows for a seamless purchasing process.

# Convenient Favorites and Orders Management
I understand the importance of providing users with the ability to save their favorite items for future reference. To facilitate this, I've included an easy-to-use feature that allows users to add products to their favorites, which can be accessed by hovering over any product. Additionally, I've incorporated tabs for easy navigation to the favorites and orders sections, where users can find valuable information related to their selected products.

Overall, this furniture ecommerce website represents my dedication to creating a professional and polished platform for users to discover, explore, and purchase furniture. I am proud to have developed this project, honing my skills as a developer and implementing innovative technologies to enhance the user experience.
